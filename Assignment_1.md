# Discrete Structure Assignment 1
The solution created by our group from the question assigned by the professor: [DS_Assignment1]([file:///C:/Users/DELL/Downloads/DS_Y1S1_A1%20(1).pdf](https://sg.docworkspace.com/d/sICTv2-DYAePGu7wG))

**Reflection:**
It was not a smooth journey when math questions were required to be solved in groups rather than individually. There are arguments and disagreements while solving the questions due to
different methods and different final answers. However, it turns out that we learned more solving techniques and different perspectives on solving math questions. This study method truly makes us improve quickly compared to solving the questions alone.
All the efforts and time of my group members are highly appretiated, I am still looking forward to academic arguments with my group members in the future.
