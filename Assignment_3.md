# Discrete Structure Assignment 3
The solution created by our group from the questions assigned by the professor: [DS_Assignment3](https://sg.docworkspace.com/d/sIBnv2-DYAcDSu7wG)

There are topics from the previous assignment, Permutation and Combination, and a new topic Graph Theory included in this assignment. With the strong basics, I mastered from the previous assignment for 
Permutation and Combination, it is not difficult for me to solve the questions that require permutation and combination. As for the tree theory, it requires much visualization, fortunately, I am good at visualizing
as I am a delusional person. Therefore, this topic gives me time to shine as I have the opportunity to teach my team members the theory and visualization revolve around the graph theory topic. This boosts my
confidence and self-esteem in mathematics. However, humbleness is one of the keys to success so when I have any questions, I will not hesitate to ask questions and always learn new perceptions from others.
