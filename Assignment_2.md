**Reflection:**
Recurrence relation, Counting methods and probability, Permutation and Combination, and the pigeonhole principle are challenging topics for me, but with the help of my team members, I managed to grasp the core 
concept and understand the basics of these topics. These challenges only excite me more to further explore the theory of mathematics with the increase exponentially for the use of logical and critical thinking. 
Before ending, I must thank my team members, Mindy and Syafiqah, who aided me patiently while solving those questions.
